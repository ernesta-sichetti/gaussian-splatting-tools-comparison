## Overview

This repository provides a **comparative overview of tools** for **3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)**, covering both **training / generation** and **visualization**.  
It documents and classifies:

- Commercial and open-source solutions  
- Desktop, web, and immersive viewers  
- Mobile and cloud-based pipelines  

Each tool is categorized by **type**, **platform**, **tags**, **output characteristics**, and **validation level**, indicating whether it was **experimentally tested by the author** or **declared/documented**.
